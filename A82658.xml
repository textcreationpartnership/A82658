            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Nor can it be unknowne to any underſtanding and judicious obſerver, that whatever bee pretended by the Rebells, yet the true cauſes heightning them to ſuch a degree of barbarouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, are, the inveterate hatred they beare to the true Religion, and their ambitious deſires as is moſt evident by the ſeverall Commiſſions from the Rebels, ſtiling themſelves the ſupream Counſell of the confederate Catholiques of <hi>Ireland,</hi> iſſued to men of War whom they maintained at Sea to ſpoyle the trade of this Kingdome, making themſelves abſolute and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on this Kingdome, and which is not a little fomented by all the Popiſh party throughout <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> as appeares by the large contributions ſent from all parts thither of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, Armes, Ammunition and experienced Commanders: And can it be that Gods enemies ſhould be more violent, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable for reſtoring Idolatry in a Kingdome forraine to theirs, then we zealous in propugning Gods truth in our owne againſt both barbarous Traytors and monſtrous Idolaters?

but the malitious pretences of diſaffected perſons, to excuſe their own backwardneſſe, and diſhearten ſuch as deſire to prevent the ruine of our Religion, which we hope by our cordiall and ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able indeavours may ſpéedily be prevented, and this Warre ſoone brought to a happy concluſion, And herein the concurrence of moſt of the Officers of that Kingdome adminiſters great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, who are deſirous (ſo well they affect that worke) to underwrite the one halfe of their Arreares due by way of Adventure for Land, and alſo take the one halfe of what ſhall grow due and is to come, likewiſe on the Condition of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers at the reducing of that Kingdome, deſiring onely to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt untill the worke be finiſhed.</p>
            <p>We have ſo juſt reaſon upon theſe many and convincing grounds to be ſenſible of the extraordinary Care and pious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of the well affected Party in this Kingdome, as we muſt not or cannot doubt of their ready Zeale in the ſetting for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of ſo Pious, ſo Charitable a worke, wherein the Religion we profeſſe, lies at the ſtake: and the lives of ſo many thouſand of our poore Proteſtant brethren are in apparent danger, unleſſe by preſent reliefe their approaching ruine be timely prevented, nor can we well expect that God will long bleſſe us, if we be wanting to our brethren, whoſe preſervation is ſo immediately linked to our owne ſafety, that we have much cauſe to ſuſpect this Kingdome is much indangered, when we have once abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely loſt that of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
